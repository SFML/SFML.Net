            The direction (also called "at vector") is the vector
            pointing forward from the listener's perspective. Together
            with the up vector, it defines the 3D orientation of the
            listener in the scene. The direction vector doesn't
            have to be normalized.
            The default listener's direction is (0, 0, -1).

            The up vector is the vector that points upward from the
            listener's perspective. Together with the direction, it
            defines the 3D orientation of the listener in the scene.
            The up vector doesn't have to be normalized.
            The default listener's up vector is (0, 1, 0). It is usually
            not necessary to change it, especially in 2D scenarios.

             The attenuation is a multiplicative factor which makes

             an attenuation value such as 100 will make the sound fade out
             very quickly as it gets further from the listener.

             The "minimum distance" of a sound is the maximum
             distance at which it is heard at its maximum volume. Further
             than the minimum distance, it will start to fade out according
             to its attenuation factor. A value of 0 ("inside the head
             of the listener") is an invalid value and is forbidden.
             The default value of the minimum distance is 1.

        <member name="P:SFML.Audio.SoundStream.Attenuation">
             <summary>
             Attenuation factor of the stream.
            
             The attenuation is a multiplicative factor which makes
             the music more or less loud according to its distance
             from the listener. An attenuation of 0 will produce a
             non-attenuated sound, i.e. its volume will always be the same
             whether it is heard from near or from far. On the other hand,
             an attenuation value such as 100 will make the sound fade out
             very quickly as it gets further from the listener.
             The default value of the attenuation is 1.
